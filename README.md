# DoS - Syn Flood Attack
Those programs allow you to compare the performance of worldwide scripting languages such as C and Python.
They illustrate DoS attack with Syn Flood mechanism, the attacker sending 1M Syn packets.
My goal was to analyze the performance of each Scripting language as you can see in [#C](syn_pkts_c.png) and [Python](syn_pkts_p.png).
While you running Attack.c or Attck.py redirect the output to a file like: ">>[file_name.txt]" this will give you my premade results in [#C](syn_results_c.txt) and [Pyhton](syn_results_p.txt).
The other txt files represent another machine that sending ICMP packets to get statistics of the victim response.
More visual information in [this](DDoS.pdf).
